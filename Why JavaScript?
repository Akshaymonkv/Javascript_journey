Yes, why javascipt.

So Js is a scripting language or basically a tool to build in interactive features to an application. Eventhough Js was initially build to make web development easier, now it has been 
used to even build the backedn systems.

Js is used in server-side, clint-side, mobile apps, API Integrations etc.

To list out the points why I considered JS:
1. Easy to learn
2. A lot of frameweorks are built on top of Js -  React, Vue, Angular etc. Making it easier to gain knowledgde and migrating to differnet frameworks.
