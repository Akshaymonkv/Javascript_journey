//Operators in js.

//Basic arithmetic operators
//1. Addition operator
        var a = 5
        var b = 6
        var c = a+b;
        console.log(c);

//2. Substraction operator
        var a = 5
        var b = 6
        var c = b-a;
        console.log(c);

//3. Multiplication operator
        var a = 5
        var b = 6
        var c = b*a;
        console.log(c);

//. Division operator
        var a = 5
        var b = 6
        var c = b/a;
        console.log(c);

//Comparision operators in js//
/*Similar to the arithmetic operators, the coparision operators are '==','===','!=',
                                                                    '<=','>=','>','<', '!==' etc */
