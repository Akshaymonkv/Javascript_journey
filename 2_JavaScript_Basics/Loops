Loops to be xplained simple are a set of statements that can be used to repeat a particulr function
multiple times.

In Js we have mostly four times:
1. While
2. Do-While
3. For
4. For in

syntax:

while(condition){
    statement
    increment
}

do{
    statement
    increment
}
while(condition)

for(initialize var;condition;increment){
    statement
}

for in - is used mostly with fobjects
for(<var> in object){
    statement
}
