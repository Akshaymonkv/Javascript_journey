Javascript error handling:

three operators are used to handle the error in javascript

try catch and throw.

What we do in the try statement is basically, we will include the code block inside try to 
performa n operation and give the corresponding result, and the throws clause is used to give
the said corresponding result and the catch clause will store that result in it and display the 
result or handle the error
