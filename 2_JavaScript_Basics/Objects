Objects are nothing but real world entities whihc has a state and behavior.
In js we can creat objects in two different ways.

1) Using object literal
  This is the most usual and commonly used method
   var object_name = {property1:'value 1',property2:'value 2'}

2) Using object instance
   This has a slightly different syntax
   var object_name = new Object()
   object_name.property1 = value1
   object_name.property2 = value2
