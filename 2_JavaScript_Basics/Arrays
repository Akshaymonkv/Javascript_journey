Arrays to explain in the simplest form is a group of items that can be classified together.
Arrays are classified as objects in javascript. An object being anything with a set of characteristics and behavior

We can create arrays in two different ways:
1. By literal

 var A = ['A','B','C']

2. By instance of an object

 var A =  new Array()
 A[0] = 'A'
 A[1] = 'B'
