To start creating a react native project, we can use the following CLI command:

 react-native init project_name

It will create a default project with a bunch of sample code and a basic app structure.

To list out the most basic things to check out in the created project:

 * Initially control goes to a file called index.js
 * Inside index.js, the code would probably look like this:


      [[[
        
        //index.js is the first file that will run when starting a react-native project

                  import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';                //AppRegistery is a component inside      react-native, it can be considered as an entry point or root component
                  
                  import App from './App';                                //This is to import the App.js file inside the   folder, it can be renamed to anything

                  import {name as appName} from './app.json';            //App.json is a file structure which holds the app name data which is called here

                  AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);    //This actually passes the appname from app.json and calls  app.js


                                                                        //it then transfers control to App.js
      ]]]

      * App.js will contain some default content and code
      * To run a project open the terminal and give "react-native start" and the open another termainal and 
        give "react-native run-android"
